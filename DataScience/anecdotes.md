## Flood Forecasting

When a flood warning was generated, people doesn't evacuated.
Instead, children used it to know that there will be a wet playground.
People in these areas don't evacuate if water level is below hips.
So they ignored the warning. -> Flood forecasting needs to predict expected water level.
